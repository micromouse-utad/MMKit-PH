# MMKit-PH


This repository is a fork of [Peter's Harrison code](https://github.com/micromouseonline/ported-micromouse) for the [MMKit](https://www.micromouse.utad.pt/?page_id=998&lang=en). The repository was created to make it easier to run Peter's code using the Arduino IDE, as well as to help in the calibration processes needed to get the micromouse runing correctly.

## Instalation

There's no instalation required, to run the code first download its [latest release](https://github.com/micromouse-utad/MMKit-PH/releases/latest). 
After uncompressed the code in your desired location and just open the project throught the Arduino IDE, or any other IDE of your choice.
